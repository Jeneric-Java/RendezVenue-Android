# RendezVenue® by Jenerics Software  
This is your new go-to app for retrieving, collecting, and curating events on the fly within an Android environment. RendezVenue simplifies the hassle of scouring event content with a targeted search functionality to get the events you want, 
where and when you need them.

Do you prefer working with Outlook, TimeTree, or maybe even simply Google Calendar? No problem, we’ve got you covered. Effortlessly synchronised to a local calendar app of your choosing, RendezVenue takes a holistic approach with full system integration.

## Overview

RendezVenue boasts a slick UI experience, with automatic background location filtering kicking in from the get-go, granting instant access to events as far as the eye can see. Entrusting response caching and computationally-demanding processes 
to the backend keeps the user experience uninterrupted. The frontend team worked hard on embellishing the visuals with snappy graphics, elegantly designed, laid out, and all carefully chosen to complement the overarching theme.

## User Manual

## A Real Team Effort

We worked to a tight MVP, building from a clear concept to a multi-faceted, fully-functioning, and bespokely-crafted implementation. The idea for RendezVenue evolved from a desire to create a product from which all team members would benefit. This 
was about the group, not the individual; we wanted everyone to feel that the project was as much their own as it was anyone else's. 

As the project progressed, it really began to take on a life of its own. With each member taking on a particular area of interest, it is within that defined scope of operations that they were afforded the time and space to carry out targeted 
research, and so incorporate new technologies thus enhancing their code. This approach not only helped to streamline team resources, but allowed us to build upon existing skillsets to qualify the project with a unique blend of functionalities. 

### Lifecycle & CI/CD

## Security

All data relating to a user's location is encrypted for secure transmission. Jenerics Software puts the utmost priority on preserving the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive user-sourced credentials. 
We rely on 256-bit AES encryption. 

## FAQs

**On which external APIs does RendezVenue depend?**

Our ethos centres on limiting over-reliance on external APIs. We rely solely on Ticketmaster's Discovery API. 

**Where can I get RendezVenue?**

This is a work in progress. Please be aware that some of the critical files, upon which this app is reliant for AES encryption, will not be made available with this release. 

**Is RendezVenue available in Kotlin?**

Not presently. This project was foremost an exercise in developing a full-stack Android application in Java. 

**How long is a piece of string?**

Great question. For an empty string, about 40 bytes, I believe.
